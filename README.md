# Dictionary App on ReactJS

## About

You can see my app [here](https://incomparable-quokka-38a228.netlify.app/) (Hosted on Netlify) .

### Features

- word searching
- phonetics playback
- synonymous

(This app is uding two different APIs; one for definition and the other for phonetics)

## Purpose

This was a part of my learning path to Front-End development, especially ReactJS. I chose to do this project for the following reasons;

- to learn the state management: A dictionary needs to fetch definitions from an API, display them dynamically, and play pronounciation playback. 
- to learn API integration: the app fundamentally relies on consuming external API to retrieve definitions and phonetics.

## Scalability
If I decide to enhance my didctionary app in the future, ReactJS's scsalability is a major asset. I'd like to add the features below;

- antonymous
